<p>
Harper's Island started of with strong ratings but they gradually started to drop as the series went on. The show was aired on CBS in America and it was aired on RTE in Ireland. During the season, CBS moved the series to weekend, possibly to get it more attention and increase its audience as the numbers were starting to drop. At the end of the series the show ranged at number 50 being viewed in approximately 9 million homes in North America.
