Recap

<p class="recap">
After witnessing the death of Chloe, Henry and Abby are off to find Wakefield. Danny acts as bait to lure Wakefield out, but when it comes to killing him, Abby can't do it. Instead, she knocks him out and they carry him to the Police Station where they lock him up. Henry goes to find Trish and Jimmy, but they have left the car. While at the station, Shea tells the group that Sheriff Mills suspected Jimmy of being a Wakefield copycat, causing the group to analyze Jimmy's behavior and brushes with death. Jimmy comes to the station, seemingly upset that Trish has fallen off a cliff and is stuck.

Wakefield reveals to Abby that she is in fact the reason behind the killings, and that he really loved her mother. He reveals that Abby's mother gave Wakefield's son up for adoption, but Wakefield found him. Meanwhile Jimmy, Henry, Abby, and Sully go off to rescue Trish, who they find unharmed.
