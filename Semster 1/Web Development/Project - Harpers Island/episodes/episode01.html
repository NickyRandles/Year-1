Recap
</h1>
<p class="recap">
Everyone gathers on the ferry to Harper's Island for the wedding of Henry Dunn and Trish Wellington. Trish's cousin, Ben Wellington, hasn't arrived, but they decide to cast off anyway. Unbeknownst to the party on board Ben has been tied to the drive shaft of the boat with an oxygen tank and goes head first into the propeller when the engine starts.
</p>
<p class="recap">
On the voyage to the Island Henry and his life-long best friend, Abby Mills, discuss her apprehension about returning to Harper's Island. Her mother was one of the victims that John Wakefield murdered seven years ago. Among the many guests coming to the Island is Henry's Uncle Marty, who is secretly travelling with a bag of $250,000 and a gun.
</p>
<p class="recap">
The wedding party arrives at The Candlewick Inn, the setting for all of the festivities, and Abby becomes familiar with her old surroundings. Hunter Jennings, Trish's ex-boyfriend, arrives on the Island per Mr. Wellington's request. They intend to break up Trish's marriage to Henry. Uncle Marty confronts Mr. Wellington about his treatment of Henry and also his plan to break up Henry and Trish's wedding.
</p>
<p class="recap">
Later in the evening while out for a walk, Marty falls though a footbridge, gets stuck, and is cut in half by an unknown killer. Once the evening winds down, Abby returns to her room to find a newspaper article taped to her bathroom mirror about her mother's murder at the hands of John Wakefield.
