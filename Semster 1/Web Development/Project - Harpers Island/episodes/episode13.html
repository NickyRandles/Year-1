Recap
</h1>
<p class="recap">
Starting with a flashback, we see Henry and Abby are best friends. His parents come to pick him up, and through glances, it is obvious that Abby's mother and Henry's adoptive mother know what happened. Henry and Abby share a secret before he goes back home to Tacoma.
</p>
<p class="recap">
Wakefield and Henry are discussing their overall plan when they hear Abby and they leave Trish's body in the woods. Shea and Madison make to the boat house where Sully learns Wakefield has escaped. Abby and Jimmy find Trish's body, and decide to leave her there to find Henry. Meanwhile, Sully sends Shea and Madison off towards Seattle on a small boat, while Henry takes Sully into the woods to "find Trish." There, Henry tells Sully everything, but he doesn't believe him at first. Eventually he tries to shoot Henry, but he doesn't have any bullets. Henry and his father kill Sully while Henry tells him "you never should have dogged Trish," leading the audience to believe that Henry cared for Trish.
</p>
<p class="recap">
Abby and Jimmy then come across Henry, who is alone. He doesn't seem to believe them when they tell him Trish is dead. Instead, he runs to the church where Trish's body is. There Abby, Jimmy, and Henry are found by Wakefield. Wakefield attacks Jimmy, who yells for Abby to run. When she leaves the church, Wakefield yells at Henry that Abby is escaping. Jimmy connects the dots, and fights off Wakefield while Henry runs to find Abby.
</p>
<p class="recap">
Henry catches up to Abby and instead of killing her, kills Wakefield, who is surprised. Abby pieces everything together and tries to run from Henry, but she is knocked unconscious.
</p>
<p class="recap">
The scene shifts to Shea and Madison who are informed that they are the only survivors, other than a handful of locals. The scene shifts yet again to Abby, who wakes in a house. Downstairs, she finds Henry. He explains that they were meant to be together, and that no one knows they are half-siblings, which makes everything okay. Attempting to escape, she finds Jimmy who is tied up. Henry has him sign a full confession in exchange for keeping Abby safe. Henry gets jealous when Abby admits she loves Jimmy and he slaps her. While on the floor, Abby stabs Henry in the foot. Having slipped Jimmy tools to help him unlock himself, Abby leads Henry on a chase, where she tells him that she doesn't want or love him. Distraught, he doesn't notice Jimmy coming up on him, and together, Henry and Jimmy go off a cliff. While checking on Jimmy, Henry walks up behind Abby and she stabs him. His last words to her are "Abby, I love you." Abby and Jimmy make it off the island safely.
