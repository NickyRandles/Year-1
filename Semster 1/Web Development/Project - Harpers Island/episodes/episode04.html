Recap

<p class="recap">
Driving into town, Jimmy and Abby reminisce and begin to rekindle their relationship. Once in town, Abby visits the local newspaper - Harper's Globe - to pick up a childhood picture of Trish and Henry for her wedding gift. While waiting, Abby is spooked by old newspapers featuring the Wakefield murders; Robin Matthews tells her that someone was inquiring about them but the person never came to pick them up.

<p class="recap">
The day of the bachelor and bachelorette parties have arrived. While out fishing, Henry and his groomsmen come across Hunter's boat. They discover his body and the bag of money with the gun. They decide not to report it and sink the boat instead, taking the money and gun. When they return to the Candlewick Inn, the men agree to deal with the $250,000 that they confiscated after the wedding.
</p>
<p class="recap">
When two men enter the Inn with concealed weapons, the groomsmen decide that they need to hide the money immediately. Booth heads out into the woods to bury the money and Malcolm follows him. Accidentally, Booth shoots himself in the leg and bleeds to death in Malcolm's arms. At the bachelor party, they are relived to discover the two men are bouncers for the stripper. Malcolm arrives and lies about seeing Booth. Back in his hotel room, Malcolm hides the bag of money and mourns the loss of his friend.
