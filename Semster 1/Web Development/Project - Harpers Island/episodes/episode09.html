Recap

<p class="recap">
After reading John Wakefield's journal, Abby finds out she could be his daughter. After over-hearing this information, Shane tells everyone still staying in the Candlewick Inn that he believes Abby is the murderer, causing the party to start turning on her and each other. This tension causes Abby to realize that she is in the center of the killings. After denying Abby a place inside the Inn, Shane is attacked by Henry, who is only stopped when the group pulls him off. Meanwhile, Cal and Chloe are attending the Sheriff Mills' leg injury. Chloe gets turned on when Cal saves his life and they sleep together in a separate room. Cal wakes up to discover that the Sheriff is missing.

After finding her safe in a room, Abby and Madison attempt to find their way out of the tunnels, only to be found by Trish and Shea who were driving to see the psychic.
